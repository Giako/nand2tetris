# nand2tetris by Giako
Nand2Tetris project by me (see http://nand2tetris.org/)

This repository contains my solutions to the projects proposed in the above website and in the book "The Elements of Computing
Systems" by Nisan & Schocken (awesome book, I suggest to go through the projects!).

For more information check the [Nand2Tetris](http://nand2tetris.org/) website.
